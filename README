Minicards
---------

This is stuff I'm going to use to generate the artwork for the back of my Moo minicard business cards.

Notes:

Moo minicard artwork should be 874 pixels by 378 pixels.

canvas.x has a factor of 38 = 23 blocks wide
canvas.y has a factor of 27 = 14 blocks tall

TODO:

Include RMagick, desaturate, and draw shapes on top of the background.
